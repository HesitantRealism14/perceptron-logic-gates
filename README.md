# perceptron-logic-gates
Using sklearn.linear_model's Perceptron() to reperesent AND and OR logic gates

Linear decision boundaries for AND & NAND as well as for OR & NOR are the same, therefore only included AND and OR logic gates here.
Additionally, XAND & XOR data are not linearly separable, therefore a Perceptron won't be able to find a linear boundary.
